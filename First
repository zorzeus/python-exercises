> Exercise: Free Fall Simulation

**
Task:

Simulate the free fall of an object with a known initial height. Use basic physics formulas for free fall.
Steps:

    The user should enter the initial height of the object in meters.

    Use the physics formula for free fall to calculate the time it takes for the object to fall to the ground. The formula for free fall is:

    s=ut+12gt2s=ut+21â€‹gt2

    where:
        ss - the height of the object (initial height)
        uu - initial velocity (0 in free fall)
        tt - time of fall
        gg - acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2 on Earth)

    Print the time of fall on the screen.

Sample Code:

python
# Step 1: Enter the initial height
initial_height = float(input("Enter the initial height of the object in meters: "))

# Step 2: Calculate the time of fall
gravity_acceleration = 9.8
fall_time = (2 * initial_height / gravity_acceleration) ** 0.5

# Step 3: Print the result
print(f"The object will fall to the ground in {fall_time:.2f} seconds.")

This example combines basic programming steps (data input, calculation, result display) with physics concepts related to free fall. You can further expand this exercise, for instance, by adding an option to input different values for gravitational acceleration or additional calculations to make the exercise more complex as the student progresses.
